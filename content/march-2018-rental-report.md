March Rental Stats
---------------------

There has been a consistent uptick in rental volumes since last year. In March, we saw 5520 listings which is 26.9% more listings than last March. This marks 3 consecutive months of higher YoY listings. Year-to-date we recorded 16,115 listings versus 14,000 for the same period in 2017, a 15% increase. I am cautiously optimistic that newly introduced measures like the Empty Homes Tax are driving more rental stock. 

Prices were a mixed bag. Studios and 2 bedrooms saw slight moderation while 1 bedrooms and 3 bedrooms saw some growth in rental pricing. The good news is we are still off from the high water mark of $2000 for a single bedroom seen last September. 

* Studios $1624.50 (-1.5%)
* 1 bedrooms $1980 (+1.5%)
* 2 bedrooms $2695 (-0.2%)
* 3 bedrooms $3000 (3.4%) 

**Year-Over-Year**

One bedrooms saw a large year-over-year price surge of almost 9%. There appears to have been a structural change in the rental market in the summer of 2017. For 1 BRs, median prices escalated from  $1850 to $2000, and these prices have been stubbornly sticky.

Beds | Median 2017 |  Median 2018 | Pct Change
---- | ----------- | ------------ | --------------
0 | $1570 | $1624.5 | %3.5	
1	| $1820	| $1980 |	%8.8
2	| $2600	| $2695 |	%3.6	
3	| $2750	| $3000	| %9.1

**Furnished**

Thanks to Jens heckling, I've finally split out the furnished and unfurnished listings. The results are pretty shocking, at least to me. 

The median price of a furnished unit offers at least a 30% premium to its unfurnished counterpart. 

Beds | Median Unfurnished |  Median Furnished | Pct Premium
---- | ----------- | ------------ | --------------
0 | $1500 | $2000 | %33.3
1	| $1850	| $2400 |	%29.7
2	| $2495	| $3495 |	%40.1
3	| $2700	| $5112.5	| %89.4

Coincidentally, furnished units make up about 30% of the listings. This tails off as we get to the higher bedroom counts though. 

Beds | Unfurnished Count|  Furnished Count | Pct Furnished
---- | ----------- | ------------ | --------------
0 | 181 | 95 | %34.4
1	| 1687	| 775 |	%31.5
2	| 1479	| 571 |	%27.9
3	| 374	| 106	| %22.1
