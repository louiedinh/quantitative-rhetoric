Currently, plans at all three levels of government could cause ripples in our rental data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Federally, recent statements from the Bank of Canada signal their intention to slowly back away from emergency interest rates. At Trois-Rivières, senior deputy governor Wilkins &lt;a href="http://www.bankofcanada.ca/2016/10/economic-trends-monetary-policy/"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; oil revenue isn't doing so hot, but the non-resource economy has been growing steadily. This was supported by a &lt;a href="http://www.statcan.gc.ca/daily-quotidien/170609/dq170609a-eng.htm?HPA=1&amp;amp;indid=3587-2&amp;amp;indgeo=0"&gt;surprisingly large increase in full time employment&lt;/a&gt; (+77,000) and increasingly positive business outlook. In Portugal, BoC governer Poloz said that low rates have "done their job". A rate hike means higher mortgage costs which usually means lower housing prices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here in BC, Christie Clark is still putting up a fight. The latest proposed house-price-inflating measure is a rent-to-own system released with the &lt;a href="http://www.rew.ca/news/bc-liberals-announce-rent-to-own-housing-scheme-1.20724004"&gt;throne speeech on June 22nd&lt;/a&gt;. The idea is to create 50,000 units in partnership with the private sector. We don't know any particulars but the idea exists elsewhere. Generally, a renter, after a fixed lease, has the option to purchase the home. Once again, the Liberals are covertly pushing the idea that renting is "flushing your money down the toilet". You don't need to pay attention though because NDP/Greens have given Christie the boot and taking a shot at governing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, Gil Kelly our new planner from down south, delivered a &lt;a href="http://council.vancouver.ca/20170628/documents/pspc6.pdf"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; to the City about our empty homes problem. Apparently the census last year found approximately 25,000 dwellings (8.2% of our stock) that were unoccupied or occupied by temporary residents. Similar census counts from 2001 shows that this has grown from ~13,000 (+5.2%). The report explicitly recommends against any exceptions for second homes, or houses on the market. If deemed empty, the owner forks up a hefty 1% of the assessed value per year. The deadline to rent out a dwelling and avoid the tax is July 1st. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, the new tax did not result in an uptick in rental inventory across the city. I guess some owners will just cough up the empty homes tax. The rest have probably listed earlier in the year, explaining the huge spike in volume we saw in January. In June, listing volume across the city dropped 2%. Sunset (+28%) and Marpole (+17%) saw large increases, but this was offset by fewer listings in Downtown (-5%).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the price side, the market seems to be split in two. Family units (2+ bedrooms) are seeing price appreciation while the one bedrooms and studios have not. In fact, studios (-2.5%) saw a dip in median rent for the month of June and go for $1560. Median rent for 2 bedrooms is now at $2550 (+2%) and 3 bedrooms goes for $2900 (+1.75%). One bedrooms had no change in price, with median rents still at $1850.&lt;/p&gt;

Here are links to the &lt;a href="http://quantitativerhetoric.com/vancouver-rental-landscape.html"&gt;first&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://quantitativerhetoric.com/rentals-go-fast-and-its-expensive-to-live-downtown.html"&gt;second&lt;/a&gt; posts.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We expect some &lt;a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/british-columbia/ndp-greens-seek-ways-to-cool-british-columbias-housing-market/article35185394/"&gt;new measures aimed at cooling the housing market&lt;/a&gt; if the NDP and Greens sucessfully form government. Wouldn't it be great to see if anything is working? Ideally, we would look at housing sale prices but the released aggregates are &lt;a href="https://betterdwelling.com/city/vancouver/the-canadian-government-thinks-vancouver-homes-are-cheaper-than-in-2008-seriously/"&gt;clear as mud&lt;/a&gt;. Instead, let's use our rental data as a proxy. Since changes in buying sentiment shifts the rent vs. buy equation, we should be able to observe effects indirectly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To do this, we have to start recording data now to serve as a baseline. So, I'm going to start writing these rental reports on a monthly basis. Each report will summarize that month's data along with comparisons to the historical trend. Ready? Let's go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the month of May, we saw rental volumes pulling back slightly (-3%) across the city. Decreasing volume was mainly driven by lower supply in Sunset and Marpole. In the other 4 rent-dense areas (Downtown, Mount-Pleasant-E/W, and Point Grey) volumes have been stable MoM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the price front, the median cost of rentals have been stable for 1 ($1850) and 2 ($2500) bedrooms. However, prices for Studios (+3.22%) and 3 bedrooms (+1.78%) have risen slightly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, despite all the sales news, the rental situation in Vancouver has stayed mostly the same in the last few months. Is this the calm before the storm?&lt;/p&gt;

The initial post on Vancouver's rental market can be found &lt;a href="http://quantitativerhetoric.com/vancouver-rental-landscape.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s face it, renting in Vancouver isn’t easy. The prices are high and the competition is stiff. Rumor has it that no one can find pet-friendly housing and if you do luck out, you’ll get renovicted in a few months anyways. Just the thought of having to move sends me into a sweaty panic. But are we stressed out with good reason? How bad is it really? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bad news first. Rents are indeed increasing and most listed units are gone within the week. This is from looking at rental postings on CL for the last 6 months. But things are not all bad. The price increases are uneven across the city, and smaller units are slightly easier to find.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Rent Increases Have Been Localized to Downtown.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking across the city rents have been pretty consistent since December 2016. One bedroom price changes are hovering around 0, while two bedrooms swing but in both directions. Downtown is the outlier, with rents increasing every month since last December. The median one bedroom in Downtown now costs north of $2000. Padmapper found similar numbers in their recent &lt;a href="http://blog.padmapper.com/2017/05/16/2017-may-rent-report-canada/"&gt;rental report&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if you’re apartment hunting, try looking around the city instead. In four of the five most rental-dense neighbourhoods, rents rose towards the end of the year but then quickly moderated into January and February. Though more recently, prices have ticked up between 5% and 10%. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/static/rentals-over-time_files/figure-html/median-rents-overall-1.png" /&gt;&lt;!-- --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/static/rentals-over-time_files/figure-html/median-rent-by-nbhd-1.png" /&gt;&lt;!-- --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/static/rentals-over-time_files/figure-html/median-rent-change-1.png" /&gt;&lt;!-- --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;If You Spot a Good Place, Act Fast.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because about half of all units disappear within just three days of listing.  Wait ten days and 80% of listings are gone. These numbers change a bit depending on the size and location though. Studios stay listed for a bit longer than one bedrooms, which last longer than 2 bedrooms. Also, it’s easier to find a listing in Downtown because you get about about 12 hours extra compared to Sunset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/static/rentals-over-time_files/figure-html/city-wide-absorption-1.png" /&gt;&lt;!-- --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/static/rentals-over-time_files/figure-html/absorption-by-bed-1.png" /&gt;&lt;!-- --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/static/rentals-over-time_files/figure-html/absorption-by-nbhd-1.png" /&gt;&lt;!-- --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/static/rentals-over-time_files/figure-html/absorption-by-nbhd-zoom-1.png" /&gt;&lt;!-- --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Waiting Doesn’t Work. Try Asking?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, about 15% of landlords &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; revise their prices and usually downwards. However, this is unrelated to the number of days the unit has been listed. Most discounts are within 10% of the original price. You’d think the owners would back down after a few weeks but alas, rental prices are sticky. You might have better luck appealing to their sentimental side. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/static/rentals-over-time_files/figure-html/price-change-scatter-1.png" /&gt;&lt;!-- --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/static/rentals-over-time_files/figure-html/pct-change-histogram-1.png" /&gt;&lt;!-- --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/static/rentals-over-time_files/figure-html/against-dom-1.png" /&gt;&lt;!-- --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Final Remarks&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So after looking at the data, we recommend the following course of action:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To find a good deal, try looking outside of downtown where prices have mostly been stable. If you really want to live in the heart of the city, be prepared to shell out especially for 2 or more bedrooms. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make sure to act fast. Most places are gone within a week of posting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Waiting for a landlord to drop their prices doesn’t usually work. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

This is normal in Asian families. As a kid, I obviously couldn't afford it. Over time my earnings have grown along with my age but the sky rocketing prices leave real estate perpetually out of reach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To a housing hopeful, the news coverage is an emotional roller coaster. One day sales collapse and hope is restored, only to be followed by a surge that leaves prices at dizzying new heights. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lack of hard data was frustrating so I decided to do a little digging on my own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This particular post explores the rental market in Vancouver. Sales numbers are exciting, but hard to compile and strongly affected by speculation. Rental prices are more stable and act as a proxy for demand of living space. We will be exploring where rentals are located within the city, and how much it will cost to rent in each neighbhourhood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My data source is a popular online rental marketplace. The data was retrieved between November 6th, 2016 and December 9th, 2016. After cleaning and removal of duplicates, the dataset contains 5138 listings in the city of Vancouver. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To aid this investigation, I arbitrarily split Vancouver into neighbhourhoods. The grid lines are eyeballed to approximate the neighbourhood boundaries and labeled with names off the top of my head. Please don't take them literally. I know they are wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is my arbitrarily labelled map of Vancouver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/static/vancouver-rental-landscape_files/figure-html/setup-1.png" /&gt;&lt;!-- --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, where are all these rentals located? A quick plot shows us that rentals are not evenly spread across the city. Here each dot is a rental posting. There is a large concentration in Downtown and along the Broadway corridor between Arbutus and Nanaimo. The rest of Vancouver is sparse in terms of vacancies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/static/vancouver-rental-landscape_files/figure-html/density-plot-1.png" /&gt;&lt;!-- --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Breaking this down further, we can see that Downtown 47%, Mt-Pleasant-W (9%) and Mt-Pleasant-E (5%) account for more than half of the rental stock. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/static/vancouver-rental-landscape_files/figure-html/rental-dist-1.png" /&gt;&lt;!-- --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although rentals in Downtown and along Broadway are abundant, they might not be ideal for families. Diving into the bedroom and square footage distributions, we notice that neighbourhoods can have very distinct rental stock profiles. Some neighbourhoods have many more 1 Bedroom units (BRs), than others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/static/vancouver-rental-landscape_files/figure-html/bedroom-dist-1.png" /&gt;&lt;!-- --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High rental density areas probably correspond to higher density buildings like apartments. Notice that Downtown and Mt-Pleasant-E have very distinct staircase patterns in the bedroom distribution. Many one bedrooms, then less two bedrooms, etc. In older neighbourhoods, where we expect more single family dwellings, the pattern is different. We see many more dwellings with 2 or more BRs (e.g Renfrew, Sunset and Cambie). Also, there are some nice intermediate neighbourhoods where we see the two patterns mixing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's hard to prove this is the case using our current dataset, but can probably be verified in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The size distribution is not that exciting. As previously identified, the neighbourhoods show two distinct patterns, with some mixing. The size distribution follows a similar trend to our bedrooms. 
&lt;img alt="" src="/static/vancouver-rental-landscape_files/figure-html/size-dist-1.png" /&gt;&lt;!-- --&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/static/vancouver-rental-landscape_files/figure-html/size-dist-2.png" /&gt;&lt;!-- --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we look at the price distribution. Let's be honest, rent in Vancouver are not cheap. The most distinct pattern is the East/West divide. The median west side home is priced over $2000 for every neighbhourhood except Marpole. Conversely, none are over $2000 on the east side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A common rule of thumb is that you can comfortably spend at most 33% of your income on housing costs. This works out to $72,000 take-home pay or $95,000 in gross salary. Of course, this is for median household, not just a single person. A newly graduated student living with a roommate would target a much different rental market than a 4 person family. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/static/vancouver-rental-landscape_files/figure-html/price-dist-1.png" /&gt;&lt;!-- --&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/static/vancouver-rental-landscape_files/figure-html/price-dist-2.png" /&gt;&lt;!-- --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even this high level view of the hard data allows us to draw some conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A large fraction of rentals (0.62) available in Vancouver are in Downtown and on the Broadway corridor between Nanaimo and Arbutus.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Two main neighbourhood patterns emerge: high density, small units with fewer bedrooms. Or low density, lots of bedrooms, and space. A few neighbourhoods are a mixture of these two patterns.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rent on the east side is much cheaper than the west side.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the next post, we will explore the factors that lead to higher prices and what you can expect to rent for in each neigbhourhood.&lt;/p&gt;
