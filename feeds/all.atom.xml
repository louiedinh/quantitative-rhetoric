&lt;p&gt;December was a quiet month in terms of housing. Instead of the usual blurb, I want to make observations about three broad trends  in the 2017 QR data in 2017. Let's see if these trends extrapolate into 2018. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rental market in 2017 was cyclical. Rental volumes started high in January, slowly tightened up between March and July, and then finished with rising volumes towards the end of the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In tandem with (1), prices also appear cyclical. The price rise lags the lowered volume by a few months though. Prices start rising around June, and peak in September.    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, rents are not skyrocketing. Year-over-year price increases have been in line with inflation. In fact, non-studio market rents have grown less than the legistlated cap of 3.7%&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;December Rental Stats&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;December was a sleepy month for rental listings. Volumes are down 8% from the November surge in listings. Prices are all basically flat. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Studios $1600 (-0.63%)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 bedrooms $1900 (0.0%)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2 bedrooms $2650 (0.0%)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3 bedrooms $3000 (0.0%) &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Year-Over-Year&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, year-over-year rental increases are in line with inflation. Surprisingly, the median rent for 2 bedroom units became slightly cheaper YoY. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;

&lt;/thead&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;$1525&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;$1600&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;%4.90&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;$1850&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;$1900&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;%2.70&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;$2700&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;$2650&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;-%1.90&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;3&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;$3000&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;%2.56&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's it for December and Happy Belated New Year! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;November was the month of housing strategies. In an unusually coordinated fashion, all three levels of government are staking out their positions on the housing portfolio. Vancouver and Ottawa have released official housing strategies while the BC government is promising more details in their February budget. I'm only going to talk about the CoV strategy today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The City of Vancouver has adopted a &lt;a href="http://council.vancouver.ca/20171128/documents/rr1appendixa.pdf"&gt;Housing Strategy&lt;/a&gt; for the next 10 years. Several people, like &lt;a href="https://www.gensqueeze.ca/tell_vancouver_city_council_you_support_the_new_housing_plan_but_need_some_specificity"&gt;Paul Kershaw&lt;/a&gt; (Generation Squeeze) and &lt;a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/housing-vancouver-strategy-i-want-to-believe-in-miracles/article37169583/"&gt;Steve Quinn&lt;/a&gt; (CBC), have expressed cautious optimism. I'm in agreement. The plan has a lot going for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the plan, The CoV finally recognizes that housing prices are an issue for the majority of Vancouverites. This is a shift from their previous focus on assisting only the most economically marginalized. The plan has details on how to address both the demand and supply sides of the housing equation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the demand side, speculation is acknowledged as a major driver. The plan has three planks for addressing demand:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Taxes and other policies that encourage living in the homes. Examples include the empty homes tax and the AirBnB regulations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clarify land use policy that discourages land speculation and stablizes price growths going forward.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gather more data to understand where demand is coming from. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third point is promising. We like to blame foreign money but it's hard to know the breakdown of foreign versus local money. A recent article over at &lt;a href="https://betterdwelling.com/so-are-we-talking-about-these-canadian-cities-where-multiple-mortgages-are-rising/"&gt;Better Dwelling&lt;/a&gt; points to a big rise in second mortgages in Vancouver. One possibility is existing owners withdrawing equity to put a down payment on a second unit. Without peeking at the true ownership data, it's hard to know how much speculative demand is our own fault. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the supply side, the city is pushing some fairly aggressive ideas and targets. The best ones, in my opinion, are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Allowing the densification of single family home neighbhourhoods. We are finally going to stop housing 35% of our population 80% of our land. &lt;a href="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2016/06/17/sdh-zoning-and-land-use/"&gt;Source: Mountain Math&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;62,000 new units for households making less than $80,000 per year. For reference, there were 309,418  units in the City of Vancouver according to the 2016 census. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Attempting to create "Rental Only Zones". This would help provide security of tenure, one of the oft cited benefits of owning, to the the city's renting population. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fun fact, I was shocked to find out that 53% of the city's population is renting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OK enough with the chatter, stats here we come!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;November Rental Stats&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prices are down again in November and listing volumes have picked up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Volumes are up 4.18% month-over-month in November to 5078 listings. Marpole and Sunset saw a -3% tightening in listings, but all other major neighbhourhoods got more supply (Downtown +3.8%, Mount Pleasant +7% and Point Grey 6%).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Median prices are also moderating along with the increased volume. Studios are roughly the same at $1590 versus $1600 last month. One bedrooms and two bedrooms are down $50 a piece to $1900 and $2650 respectively. Three bedrooms are up a sliver to $3000 though. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Studios $1590 (-0.63%)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 bedrooms $1900 (-2.6%)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2 bedrooms $2650 (-1.8%)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3 bedrooms $3000 (+0.20%) &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Year-Over-Year&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;November is a big month because we finally have year-over-year data! In general, rental costs have gone up between 2% and 3% depending on the number of bedrooms. Studios were an outlier with a 6% increase, possibly due to newer units coming online. Remember those panic-inducing rental increases over the summer that drove one-bedrooms median rents to $2000? It looks like they were seasonal. Whew. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MISSING DATA WARNING&lt;/strong&gt;: Due to the missing data last month, we do not look at rental volumes in September. I do include September for the median price analysis though. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;October Real Estate Happenings&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First off, congratulations to Hector Bremner for winning the city by-election. He ran on a &lt;a href="http://hectorbremner.com/housing/"&gt;strong housing platform of increasing density across the city&lt;/a&gt;. Let's see if he can follow through. Gregor must be sweating at night thinking about next year's election. I have nothing against bike lanes, but &lt;a href="https://thinkpol.ca/2017/10/31/city-of-vancouver-resumes-accepting-vistro11s-complaints-following-outcry/"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/cmhc-housing-outlook-1.4373251"&gt;housing&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.vancourier.com/opinion/vancouver-development-community-shocked-by-new-normal-in-real-estate-prices-1.23074903"&gt;problem&lt;/a&gt; is &lt;a href="https://globalnews.ca/news/3827172/metro-vancouver-rent-census/"&gt;getting&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/vancouver-strata-lawyer-preparing-class-action-lawsuit-against-airbnb-1.4368283"&gt;ridiculous&lt;/a&gt;. Thankfully (?) the problem has gotten so bad that &lt;a href="http://theprovince.com/news/local-news/ryan-holmes-hootsuite-ceo-without-affordable-housing-vancouver-risks-becoming-an-economic-ghost-town"&gt;companies started complaining about loss of talent&lt;/a&gt;. That ought to light a fire under their butts.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of winning elections based on housing policy, the NDP have &lt;a href="https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2017MAH0010-001815"&gt;drafted&lt;/a&gt; a much needed change to the yearly lease loophole. This change targets owners abusing a vacate clause in rental legislation to circumvent the maximum rental increase of inflation plus two percent. The exact number of directly affected tenants is unclear. However, its existence adds to the psychological angst of renting and encourages buying in this &lt;a href="https://betterdwelling.com/us-federal-reserve-indicator-shows-canadian-real-estate-is-way-overpriced/"&gt;overvalued market&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The people, especially folks on &lt;a href="https://wwww.reddit.com/r/vancouver/"&gt;/r/vancouver&lt;/a&gt;, are getting impatient with the NDP. Personally, I'm waiting until February when the government delivers their full budget. I hope John Horgan knows that inaction on the housing file guarantees the NDP a spot on the opposition bench for another couple of decades. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, the OSFI's &lt;a href="http://www.osfi-bsif.gc.ca/Eng/osfi-bsif/med/Pages/b20_dft_nr.aspx"&gt;stress testing guidelines&lt;/a&gt; have been released. Everyone applying for a mortgage must be eligible under the contracted mortgage rate plus two percent or the five year benchmark rate, whichever is greater. Back of the envelope calculations show that this change will reduce a household's purchasing power by up to 18%. Predicting the future is tough, but I'll stick out my neck and say that this certainly won't help price appreciation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OK. Enough rambling. Onto the stats! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;October Rental Stats&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will compare against August because of the missing September data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number of listings in October was robust. There were 4874 listings, close to our high water mark for the summer. Growth was very spikey however. Downtown listings grew by 12%, but the other major neighbhourhoods declined. Mount Pleasant (East) actually saw a volume decline of 17%. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My working theory is that students and summer visitors are leaving. Since visitors are overwhelmingly located in downtown, we would see volumes increase. The rest of the city is less affected by this trend, and would continue to see tightening. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the first time in a long time, we have price moderation. This would be consistent with the outflow of visitors in the more expensive core areas. Since these units are more pricey, the extra volume would cause landlords to ease up on their asking prices. I heard some rumbling of having to lower rents on Twitter, but it's nice that our data confirms it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Studios $1600 (-3%)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 bedrooms $1950 (-2.5%)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2 bedrooms $2700 (-1.8%)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3 bedrooms $2950 (-0.2%) &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's it for October. &lt;/p&gt;

I've compared against a few other sources, and the price measures are pretty consistent. I will not post the neighbhourhood breakdowns because of small samples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;September Real Estate Happenings&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On September 6th, the Bank of Canada pulled the trigger, raising interest rates to a whopping 1%. People who have fixed mortgages won't feel anything until renewal, but variable rates have been affected. This boost also affects the 1.9M Canadians borrowing against their homes through HELOCs. It's not so bad though, considering that a .25% increase in interest rates results in only an extra $167 in interest payments for the average HELOC amount ($67,000).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In BC, our housing minister, as her first act, has strengthened the Residential Tenancy Branch (RTB) with additional funding. The RTB will receive an additional $7 million over the next three years. This funding will be used, in part, to open up 26 new positions; the most exciting being a position for innovation! There are also talks of "imminent" legislation aimed at closing the 1-year lease loophole allowing land lords to keep resetting rents to market rates. These are all small steps in the right direction, and I look forward to their full budget next February. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I came across an &lt;a href="https://medium.com/@andersem/a-guy-just-transcribed-30-years-of-for-rent-ads-heres-what-it-taught-us-about-sf-housing-prices-bd61fd0e4ef9"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; about predicting rental prices in San Francisco. Eric Fisher, a resident of SF, tabulated rental prices in the city back to 1979. Then, he tried to find factors that could be used to predict rental prices. Apparently, rental prices can be accurately inferred from just 3 factors: the number of jobs, the number of existing units, and the local wages.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;September Rental Stats&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the first 18 days of September, compared against the same period in other months, listings grew 54%. I'd be careful reading too much into this though due to data missing-ness. Volume growth is probably driven by turnover of yearly student leases. This turnover would also explain why there is no corresponding drop in price. In fact, rental prices are on their way up again as landlords keep testing what the markets will bear. Medians for one bedrooms broke the $2000 mark (+2.6% MoM), two bedrooms are now at $2750 (+5.8% MoM) and three bedrooms at $3000 (+1.7% MoM). Only studios have been stable at $1650. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Studios $1650 (+0%)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 bedrooms $2000 (+2.6%)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2 bedrooms $2750 (+5.8%)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3 bedrooms $3000 (+1.7%) &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A new stress-test proposal from the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (OSFI) could rattle the housing market. The proposal is to stress test all uninsured mortgages at the quote plus two%. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a quick reminder, if your down payment is less than 20% then you need to insure your mortgage. If you can dig up 20%, then your mortgage is uninsured. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previously, OFSI introduced a similar stress-test but only on uninsured mortagages. Instead of cooling the housing market, the test &lt;a href="https://betterdwelling.com/canadian-uninsured-mortgages-hit-all-time-high-at-end-of-2016/"&gt;pushed buyers into uninsured mortgages&lt;/a&gt;. Typically, you can borrow money, from family or alternative lenders, to inch past the 20% mark. Voila, no stress-test. This time they are really bringing the hammer down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Others have speculated that the main cause of our housing bubble woes is the abnormally low interest rates. A stress test would boost effective interest rates by 2% overnight. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make matter worse, an interest rate hike is looking increasingly likely. Canada's Q2 performance wow'ed economists, coming in at &lt;a href="http://business.financialpost.com/news/bank-of-canada-rate-hike-odds-rise-after-blistering-gdp-growth-wows-analysts"&gt;an annualized rate of 4.5%&lt;/a&gt;. Since the prices of homes are set by how much people can borrow, this could be a perfect storm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On to the rental stats now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;August Rental Stats&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In August, listing volume across the city increased by 8%! There were almost 5000 listings in the month of August. This volume is probably because summer is ending, and people are all moving home. Just normal school year churn. Previously, only January saw more listing volume. Mt-Pleasant-E lead with +19% volume growth, while Downtown, Mt-Pleasant-W, Pt-Grey and Sunset all saw +10% volume growth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadly, this volume isn't depressing prices much. Median rentals are a mixed bag (month over month changes in parentheses). We're about to break the $2000 mark for a one bedroom apartment in Vancouver though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Studios $1650 (+0%)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 bedrooms $1950 (+2.6%)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2 bedrooms $2600 (-1.8%)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3 bedrooms $2950 (+1.7%) &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's it for August. &lt;strong&gt;If you want to stay up-to-date on Vancouver's rental market, sign up for my newsletter in the navigation bar.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;July Real Estate Happenings&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PadMapper's &lt;a href="http://blog.padmapper.com/2017/07/17/july-2017-canadian-rent-report/"&gt;rental report&lt;/a&gt; about one bedrooms at $2090 has been getting attention lately. Single room suites breaking $2000 makes a good headline, but it was mostly scare mongering. Our numbers show that median rent for July was $1900, which is a modest increase of 2.7% over June. So while one bedroom rents did go up, it's not that bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my &lt;a href="http://quantitativerhetoric.com/monthly-rental-report-june-2017.html"&gt;last report&lt;/a&gt;, I discussed the possibility of our central bank hiking interest rates. Well, it happened. On July 12th, Stephen Poloz &lt;a href="http://www.bankofcanada.ca/core-functions/monetary-policy/key-interest-rate/"&gt;pulled the trigger&lt;/a&gt; and rates are now at 0.75%. People are telling me that this is a return-to-normal. I wouldn't know though because, as a millennial, I've lived with emergency rates my entire adult life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One consequence of higher rates is that banks will loan less money to people buying real estate. Since prices are set by how much people can borrow, we could see the cost of buying come down. If prices do moderate, we will have to reconsider the &lt;a href="http://www.canadamortgage.com/calculators/rentvsown.cgi"&gt;rent-or-own&lt;/a&gt; decision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the political front, we got a new housing minister. In late June, the NDPs managed to vote the Liberals out of power. The new ruling party assigned BC's housing portfolio to Selina Robinson, a surpise pick over David Eby. The popular housing critic was instead appointed Attorney General.  Last we've heard, Robinson is currently reviewing all housing related measures&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;July Rental Stats&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In July, listing volume across the city increased by 4.6%. Mt-Pleasant-W, (+8.7%), Marpole (4.7%), and Mt-Pleasant-E (+3.2%) led the charge in volume growth. Rental volumes in other neighbhourhoods were pretty much unchanged from last month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Median rental prices are up for almost all segments (month over month changes in parentheses).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Studios $1650 (+5.7%)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 bedrooms $1900 (+2.7%)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2 bedrooms $2650 (+3.2%)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3 bedrooms $2900 (+0%) &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't know what the guys at StatsCan are doing, but they claim that inflation is sub 2%. This looks like inflation of housing costs to me. &lt;/p&gt;

Currently, plans at all three levels of government could cause ripples in our rental data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Federally, recent statements from the Bank of Canada signal their intention to slowly back away from emergency interest rates. At Trois-Rivières, senior deputy governor Wilkins &lt;a href="http://www.bankofcanada.ca/2016/10/economic-trends-monetary-policy/"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; oil revenue isn't doing so hot, but the non-resource economy has been growing steadily. This was supported by a &lt;a href="http://www.statcan.gc.ca/daily-quotidien/170609/dq170609a-eng.htm?HPA=1&amp;amp;indid=3587-2&amp;amp;indgeo=0"&gt;surprisingly large increase in full time employment&lt;/a&gt; (+77,000) and increasingly positive business outlook. In Portugal, BoC governer Poloz said that low rates have "done their job". A rate hike means higher mortgage costs which usually means lower housing prices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here in BC, Christie Clark is still putting up a fight. The latest proposed house-price-inflating measure is a rent-to-own system released with the &lt;a href="http://www.rew.ca/news/bc-liberals-announce-rent-to-own-housing-scheme-1.20724004"&gt;throne speeech on June 22nd&lt;/a&gt;. The idea is to create 50,000 units in partnership with the private sector. We don't know any particulars but the idea exists elsewhere. Generally, a renter, after a fixed lease, has the option to purchase the home. Once again, the Liberals are covertly pushing the idea that renting is "flushing your money down the toilet". You don't need to pay attention though because NDP/Greens have given Christie the boot and taking a shot at governing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, Gil Kelly our new planner from down south, delivered a &lt;a href="http://council.vancouver.ca/20170628/documents/pspc6.pdf"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; to the City about our empty homes problem. Apparently the census last year found approximately 25,000 dwellings (8.2% of our stock) that were unoccupied or occupied by temporary residents. Similar census counts from 2001 shows that this has grown from ~13,000 (+5.2%). The report explicitly recommends against any exceptions for second homes, or houses on the market. If deemed empty, the owner forks up a hefty 1% of the assessed value per year. The deadline to rent out a dwelling and avoid the tax is July 1st. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, the new tax did not result in an uptick in rental inventory across the city. I guess some owners will just cough up the empty homes tax. The rest have probably listed earlier in the year, explaining the huge spike in volume we saw in January. In June, listing volume across the city dropped 2%. Sunset (+28%) and Marpole (+17%) saw large increases, but this was offset by fewer listings in Downtown (-5%).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the price side, the market seems to be split in two. Family units (2+ bedrooms) are seeing price appreciation while the one bedrooms and studios have not. In fact, studios (-2.5%) saw a dip in median rent for the month of June and go for $1560. Median rent for 2 bedrooms is now at $2550 (+2%) and 3 bedrooms goes for $2900 (+1.75%). One bedrooms had no change in price, with median rents still at $1850.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We expect some &lt;a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/british-columbia/ndp-greens-seek-ways-to-cool-british-columbias-housing-market/article35185394/"&gt;new measures aimed at cooling the housing market&lt;/a&gt; if the NDP and Greens sucessfully form government. Wouldn't it be great to see if anything is working? Ideally, we would look at housing sale prices but the released aggregates are &lt;a href="https://betterdwelling.com/city/vancouver/the-canadian-government-thinks-vancouver-homes-are-cheaper-than-in-2008-seriously/"&gt;clear as mud&lt;/a&gt;. Instead, let's use our rental data as a proxy. Since changes in buying sentiment shifts the rent vs. buy equation, we should be able to observe effects indirectly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To do this, we have to start recording data now to serve as a baseline. So, I'm going to start writing these rental reports on a monthly basis. Each report will summarize that month's data along with comparisons to the historical trend. Ready? Let's go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the month of May, we saw rental volumes pulling back slightly (-3%) across the city. Decreasing volume was mainly driven by lower supply in Sunset and Marpole. In the other 4 rent-dense areas (Downtown, Mount-Pleasant-E/W, and Point Grey) volumes have been stable MoM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the price front, the median cost of rentals have been stable for 1 ($1850) and 2 ($2500) bedrooms. However, prices for Studios (+3.22%) and 3 bedrooms (+1.78%) have risen slightly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, despite all the sales news, the rental situation in Vancouver has stayed mostly the same in the last few months. Is this the calm before the storm?&lt;/p&gt;

The initial post on Vancouver's rental market can be found &lt;a href="http://quantitativerhetoric.com/vancouver-rental-landscape.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s face it, renting in Vancouver isn’t easy. The prices are high and the competition is stiff. Rumor has it that no one can find pet-friendly housing and if you do luck out, you’ll get renovicted in a few months anyways. Just the thought of having to move sends me into a sweaty panic. But are we stressed out with good reason? How bad is it really? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bad news first. Rents are indeed increasing and most listed units are gone within the week. This is from looking at rental postings on CL for the last 6 months. But things are not all bad. The price increases are uneven across the city, and smaller units are slightly easier to find.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Rent Increases Have Been Localized to Downtown.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking across the city rents have been pretty consistent since December 2016. One bedroom price changes are hovering around 0, while two bedrooms swing but in both directions. Downtown is the outlier, with rents increasing every month since last December. The median one bedroom in Downtown now costs north of $2000. Padmapper found similar numbers in their recent &lt;a href="http://blog.padmapper.com/2017/05/16/2017-may-rent-report-canada/"&gt;rental report&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if you’re apartment hunting, try looking around the city instead. In four of the five most rental-dense neighbourhoods, rents rose towards the end of the year but then quickly moderated into January and February. Though more recently, prices have ticked up between 5% and 10%. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/static/rentals-over-time_files/figure-html/median-rents-overall-1.png" /&gt;&lt;!-- --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/static/rentals-over-time_files/figure-html/median-rent-by-nbhd-1.png" /&gt;&lt;!-- --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/static/rentals-over-time_files/figure-html/median-rent-change-1.png" /&gt;&lt;!-- --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;If You Spot a Good Place, Act Fast.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because about half of all units disappear within just three days of listing.  Wait ten days and 80% of listings are gone. These numbers change a bit depending on the size and location though. Studios stay listed for a bit longer than one bedrooms, which last longer than 2 bedrooms. Also, it’s easier to find a listing in Downtown because you get about about 12 hours extra compared to Sunset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/static/rentals-over-time_files/figure-html/city-wide-absorption-1.png" /&gt;&lt;!-- --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/static/rentals-over-time_files/figure-html/absorption-by-bed-1.png" /&gt;&lt;!-- --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/static/rentals-over-time_files/figure-html/absorption-by-nbhd-zoom-1.png" /&gt;&lt;!-- --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Waiting Doesn’t Work. Try Asking?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, about 15% of landlords &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; revise their prices and usually downwards. However, this is unrelated to the number of days the unit has been listed. Most discounts are within 10% of the original price. You’d think the owners would back down after a few weeks but alas, rental prices are sticky. You might have better luck appealing to their sentimental side. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/static/rentals-over-time_files/figure-html/price-change-scatter-1.png" /&gt;&lt;!-- --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/static/rentals-over-time_files/figure-html/against-dom-1.png" /&gt;&lt;!-- --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Final Remarks&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So after looking at the data, we recommend the following course of action:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To find a good deal, try looking outside of downtown where prices have mostly been stable. If you really want to live in the heart of the city, be prepared to shell out especially for 2 or more bedrooms. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make sure to act fast. Most places are gone within a week of posting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Waiting for a landlord to drop their prices doesn’t usually work. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

This is normal in Asian families. As a kid, I obviously couldn't afford it. Over time my earnings have grown along with my age but the sky rocketing prices leave real estate perpetually out of reach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To a housing hopeful, the news coverage is an emotional roller coaster. One day sales collapse and hope is restored, only to be followed by a surge that leaves prices at dizzying new heights. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lack of hard data was frustrating so I decided to do a little digging on my own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This particular post explores the rental market in Vancouver. Sales numbers are exciting, but hard to compile and strongly affected by speculation. Rental prices are more stable and act as a proxy for demand of living space. We will be exploring where rentals are located within the city, and how much it will cost to rent in each neighbhourhood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My data source is a popular online rental marketplace. The data was retrieved between November 6th, 2016 and December 9th, 2016. After cleaning and removal of duplicates, the dataset contains 5138 listings in the city of Vancouver. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To aid this investigation, I arbitrarily split Vancouver into neighbhourhoods. The grid lines are eyeballed to approximate the neighbourhood boundaries and labeled with names off the top of my head. Please don't take them literally. I know they are wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is my arbitrarily labelled map of Vancouver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/static/vancouver-rental-landscape_files/figure-html/setup-1.png" /&gt;&lt;!-- --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, where are all these rentals located? A quick plot shows us that rentals are not evenly spread across the city. Here each dot is a rental posting. There is a large concentration in Downtown and along the Broadway corridor between Arbutus and Nanaimo. The rest of Vancouver is sparse in terms of vacancies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/static/vancouver-rental-landscape_files/figure-html/density-plot-1.png" /&gt;&lt;!-- --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Breaking this down further, we can see that Downtown 47%, Mt-Pleasant-W (9%) and Mt-Pleasant-E (5%) account for more than half of the rental stock. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/static/vancouver-rental-landscape_files/figure-html/rental-dist-1.png" /&gt;&lt;!-- --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although rentals in Downtown and along Broadway are abundant, they might not be ideal for families. Diving into the bedroom and square footage distributions, we notice that neighbourhoods can have very distinct rental stock profiles. Some neighbourhoods have many more 1 Bedroom units (BRs), than others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/static/vancouver-rental-landscape_files/figure-html/bedroom-dist-1.png" /&gt;&lt;!-- --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High rental density areas probably correspond to higher density buildings like apartments. Notice that Downtown and Mt-Pleasant-E have very distinct staircase patterns in the bedroom distribution. Many one bedrooms, then less two bedrooms, etc. In older neighbourhoods, where we expect more single family dwellings, the pattern is different. We see many more dwellings with 2 or more BRs (e.g Renfrew, Sunset and Cambie). Also, there are some nice intermediate neighbourhoods where we see the two patterns mixing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's hard to prove this is the case using our current dataset, but can probably be verified in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The size distribution is not that exciting. As previously identified, the neighbourhoods show two distinct patterns, with some mixing. The size distribution follows a similar trend to our bedrooms. 
&lt;img alt="" src="/static/vancouver-rental-landscape_files/figure-html/size-dist-1.png" /&gt;&lt;!-- --&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/static/vancouver-rental-landscape_files/figure-html/size-dist-2.png" /&gt;&lt;!-- --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we look at the price distribution. Let's be honest, rent in Vancouver are not cheap. The most distinct pattern is the East/West divide. The median west side home is priced over $2000 for every neighbhourhood except Marpole. Conversely, none are over $2000 on the east side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A common rule of thumb is that you can comfortably spend at most 33% of your income on housing costs. This works out to $72,000 take-home pay or $95,000 in gross salary. Of course, this is for median household, not just a single person. A newly graduated student living with a roommate would target a much different rental market than a 4 person family. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/static/vancouver-rental-landscape_files/figure-html/price-dist-1.png" /&gt;&lt;!-- --&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/static/vancouver-rental-landscape_files/figure-html/price-dist-2.png" /&gt;&lt;!-- --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even this high level view of the hard data allows us to draw some conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A large fraction of rentals (0.62) available in Vancouver are in Downtown and on the Broadway corridor between Nanaimo and Arbutus.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Two main neighbourhood patterns emerge: high density, small units with fewer bedrooms. Or low density, lots of bedrooms, and space. A few neighbourhoods are a mixture of these two patterns.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rent on the east side is much cheaper than the west side.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the next post, we will explore the factors that lead to higher prices and what you can expect to rent for in each neigbhourhood.&lt;/p&gt;
